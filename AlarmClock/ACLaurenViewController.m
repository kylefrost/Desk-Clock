/*
 This file, and its header file, actually do nothing to the project. In every project I do, I always find a way to leave a note or
     have a seret page for my girlfriend, Lauren White ( http://www.twitter.com/lauren_alexis ). She doesn't code, probably will never
     find this (and if she does, it is because I led her to it [which I already did while writing this]), but nonetheless I am
     putting this here, in my public source code, for her to eventually see.
 
 Lauren, I could not live without you. We have loved in our ups, and we have fought to love harder in our downs. Through the
     hardest of times we have found the best in each other. We have seen that no matter what comes our way, we will be together in
     the end, and happier than before. I hope that this lasts forever, and I could not imagine being with anyone else. You are my
     everything, and I would do anything for you. I love you.
